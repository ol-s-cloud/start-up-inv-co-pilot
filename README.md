# start-up-funding-predictions-SHAP-explanations
In this research we adopt an ensemble approach to model development, utilizing a combination of Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks to make predictions alongside with SHapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to address the concerns of explainability and transparency and to justify the predictions.
